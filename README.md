# Deep-Learning-models-for-Computer-Vision

All the computer Vision Models have been put in this directory.

1.[PlantDetector](https://github.com/piyush41/Plant_Detector-for-Global-Wheat-Detection) :- The state of art transformers techniques were used for object detection problems in the “DETR: End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers” paper that is published by Facebook’s research team. This algorithm has many advantages over classical object recognition techniques.

2.[Image Captioning](https://github.com/piyush41/Image-Captioning-with-attention) :- mplemented Encoder-Decoder model where Encoder uses CNN(ResNet) and Decoder is composed
of LSTM. Applied Attention mechanisms to focus on most relevant features and achieve the BLEU-4 score of 0.21 .

3. [Image Classification]
